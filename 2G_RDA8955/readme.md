# RDA8955

## About SoC

RDA8955L is a high performance, highly integrated system-on-chip solution for low cost, low power, GSM/GPRS application. Integrating all essential electronic components, including baseband, quad band RF transceiver, power management onto a single system on chip.

Built around a cost effective 32-bit XCPU RISC core running at up to 312MHz with 4k of Instruction cache and 4k of Data cache, RDA8955L offers plenty of processing power for multimedia applications. A high-performance proprietary 16/32-bit digital signal processing engine can further improve overall performance and user experience when performing complex multimedia tasks.

It is also packed with impressive connectivity for easy scalability of the system, allowing glue less interfaces to camera and multimedia companion chips, SDMMC Memory Cards and SPI devices, LCD modules and USB (slave, full speed).

RDA8955L is GPRS Class 12 enabled, and supports Full Rate (FR), Half Rate (HR), Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) voice coders. It also supports simultaneous dual network operation and integrates a SIM controller with integrated level shifters that can support two SIM cards
